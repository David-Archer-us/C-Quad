#Outline of presentation (based on the current solution)

##I. Preprocessing
- Introduce the dataset & our task
- Read the files & remove any non-alphabet characters
- Create data frame with the authors’ names as labels

##II. Classification
- Vectorize the documents with “stop words”
- Use LinearSVM as the best solution
- Our achievement

##III. Challenges
- No access to HPC
- Surprising poor performance of KNN, Logistic Regression, etc.
- Tuning parameters of models

##VI. Conclusion
- Professional news reporters have similar professional wording style
- The sea of text classification approaches and combinations of methods are worth our deeper diving
- CNN, RNN could be next tries
