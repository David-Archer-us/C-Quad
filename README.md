# C-Quad

Author identification on the Reuters 50-50 dataset.

simple_SVM.ipynb and its Python version author.py implement Support Vector Machine approach to classify the texts for 50 authors. 

Compared with TF-IDF + SVM, Dictionary + Cosine, multi-layer perceptron network, Naive Bayes, and LogisticRegression, a LinearSVC approach may reach the highest accuracy and mutual information score. 

The code should run just by opening it in Jupyter Notebook or in terminal with Pandas ready.
